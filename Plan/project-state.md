- **Visual changes:** Zero — all cards retain identical appearance

### Phase 4: Migrate Section Grids (2026-02-08)
- ✅ Replaced 8 section-specific grid classes with `.grid-cols-N` utilities
  - visuals-grid, worked-grid, life-grid, graphic-grid → grid-cols-4

### Bug Fix: Mobile Section Overlap (2026-02-08)
- ✅ Fixed section overlap on mobile (<600px breakpoint)
- ✅ Added `grid-auto-rows: auto` to mobile media query
- **Root cause:** Cards with aspect ratios (`.company-card`, `.graphic-card`, etc.) tried to maintain their proportions but were constrained to 175px grid rows, causing overflow
- **Commit:** 80c0183 "Fix mobile section overlap by resetting grid-auto-rows"
- **Impact:** Mobile layout now respects card aspect ratios and natural sizing
- **Visual changes:** Sections no longer overlap on mobile devices

## Blockers / Questions
(none yet)

## Key Decisions Made
- Keep `.live-work-grid` and `.fun-grid` as-is (unique responsive behavior)
- Keep `.cc-rewards-card` and `.personal-finance-card` class names (referenced in media queries)

### Phase 5: Minor Cleanup & Consistency (2026-02-08)
- ✅ Moved inline styles to CSS
  - Removed `style="border-radius:16px"` from 3 Spotify iframes
